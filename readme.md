# laft-laravel-api

## Requirements

- PHP >= 7.1

## Installation

- clone this repo
- run ``` composer install ``` in terminal

### Hacky version mismatch fix for the JWT package (zizaco/entrust)

This package isn't ready for laravel 5.5, but it can be fixed very quickly.
Till the vendor package is updated, we need to fix a vendor file temporary

- search for the file ``` /vendor/zizaco/entrust/src/commands/MigrationCommand.php ```
- search for the  ``` public function fire() ```
- rename it to ``` public function handle() ```

This should be fixed soon... or we can fork the package

### After this fix

- run ``` php artisan migrate ```
- run ``` php artisan  jwt:secret ```


## Auth Routes

in the ``` /routes/web.php ```

you'll find the routes *authenticate* and *logout*. 
They handle the login and logout process

The route group with the prefix ``` api ``` is protected with the ability middleware, which handles the user roles and permissions


## Frontend solution

There is a package called [laft-frontend](https://github.com/daspete/laft-frontend).

This package is a solution, solved with [nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/), which creates SSR VueJS pages. With this packs, we can create PWAs with ease :)

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing tools needed for large, robust applications. A superb combination of simplicity, elegance, and innovation give you tools you need to build any application with which you are tasked.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough documentation and video tutorial library of any modern web application framework. The [Laravel documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) is thorough, complete, and makes it a breeze to get started learning the framework.
